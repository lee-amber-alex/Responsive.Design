# Responsive.Design

## Description 
The purpose of this exercise was to recreate a responsive website using primarily Bootstrap and images that referenced aesthetic guidelines to follow.  This exercise was beneficial for exploring the many styling and structure efficiencies within Bootstrap.  It also helped simulate a real-life on-the-job scenario in which a client requests specific design details for a project. 

Below are screenshots of the project for each completed page and the deployable website can be accessed [here](https://lee-amber-alex.github.io/Responsive.Design/).
